    <p>More and more of the re- search, education, and communication we deal with involves photons and electrons flying around cyberspace. Yet, a sur- prising amount of that data still winds up in a physical format that was invented in China in the early second century—paper. After all, you and others are still reading this magazine, not to men- tion the hooks, brochures, white papers, and other documents that grease the wheels of society.</p>

  <h5>THE BIRTH OF DESKTOP PUBLISHING</h5>

  <p>	Since the invention of desktop publishing in 1985 with Aldus Page- Maker (later Adobe PageMaker), which was first used with the Ap- ple Macintosh computer a n d t h e Apple LaserWriter printer, PCs have greatly facilitated the process ofput- ting words and pictures on paper.
  As powerful as PCs are in mak- ing you look good in print, they can be equally powerful in making you look bad. Computer journalist and pundit Mitch Ratcliffe once re- marked, "A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any in- vention in human history—with
  the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila."
    <br>
  Top high-end desktop publishing programs today include QuarkX- Press (http://www.quark.com) and Adobe InDesign (http ://www. adobe .com), while top consumer-level pro- grams include Microsoft Publisher (http://office.microsoft.com/pub lisher) and Poster Software's very affordahle Publish-it (http://www .postersw.com). They all feature document templates and sometimes also include page-creation wizards that can help get you started.
    <br>
    Today's top word processors, such a s Microsoft Word (http:// office.microsoft.com), Corel Word- Perfect (http://www.corel.com), and StarOffice Writer <http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice)>, are richly endowed with design features, enabling you to use them for projects that once re- quired a desktop puhlishing program. However, word processors are still not as convenient as dedicated desktop pub- lishing programs.
  No matter what software you use or how much design automation it provides, you still need a modicum of design sense to avoid taking a pratfall.

  <h5>A GUIDE TO DESKTOP PUBLISHING</h5>

  <p>	Many books have been written to help people minimize desktop publishing mis- takes, but the bible is Looking Good in Print, which was first published 15 years ago and just celebrated its sixth edition. It's the baby of Roger C. Parker, who also does consulting, training, and speaking, with a special focus in design and marketing.
    <br>
  Parker doesn't talk to the press, ac- cording to his publicist. That's not a very good way of looking good in print, but he no doubt believes that his books speak for themselves, and, with six editions, he's probably right. Looking Good in Print is both suc- cinct and comprehensive, starting with the basics before drilling down into more advanced areas. Parker covers de- sign concepts, grids, columns, headlines, pull quotes, fonts, white space, sidebars, photos, charts, and more for newslet- ters, newspapers, ads, brochures, cata- logs, order forms, product sheets, menus, letterhead, business cards, fax cover sheets, resumes, business reports, cou- pons, and more.

  My favorite chapter of Looking Good in Print is "Common Pitfalls." To help us avoid making the usual desktop publish- ing errors, Parker offers some advice:

  <ul>

  <li>Don't create "whispering" headlines that fail to stand out. Headlines should be 		larger and bolder than the text they introduce or they'll lead to gray and bor			ing-looking pages.</li>

  <li>Don't use too many typefaces. This is still one of the oldest but most common mis		takes, and it can make a desktop published work look amateurish and confusing.</li>

  <li>Don't overuse underlining. Bold and Italic typefaces are able to emphasize import		ant points and don’t mae a page look as if it came off a typewriter.</li>

  <li>Don't include too many rules or boxes. These design elements break 		up text and facilitate reading but using too many make a page look busy and interfere with reading.</li>

  <li> Don't use too many text special effects. Placing text over a darkly shaded or intricately designed pattern, overusing rotated text, and including too many irregularly shaped text hlocks can make a page look 		frivolous and make reading difficult.</li>

  <li>Don't create same-size photos ona page. Make the most important photo larger or readers won't know where to look first.
  </li>

  <li>Don't jam pack too much information onto a page. This can make information difficult to find.</li>
  </ul>
