<div class="title redheader"><p>Text 1: The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should Be Invisible by Beatrice Warde (1900 - 1969)</p></div>
    <ul><p><em>
<li>She compares typography to goblets and notes that those who know something about wine, or profess to, will prefer a clear crystal goblet. The various elements of the drink can be observed, color, fragrance, without undue concern for the vessel that carries it. Those who prefer a gold, guilded, ornate goblet put more importance in outward appearance than in the wine itself. The typographic form that a text takes can illuminate what it is meant to carry and portray, the printed word, or it can distract or detract from or even contradict it.</li>
     </em></p>

    <p>
      <li>When we treat type appropriately we can “…spend endless years of happy experiment in devising that crystalline goblet that is worth to hold the vintage of the human mind.”
      </li>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>“Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas.” From this I feel the author means that type should not be obvious, it should not be, “oh look at me, see me look how great and brilliant I am”, but should be more sophisticated, intelligent and properly thought and laid out.
      </li>
    </p></ul>

    <div class="title redheader"><p>Text 2: Beyond Courier: Good writing deserves good typography, Walt Crawford</p></div>
        <ul><p><em>
    <li>Content may be the crucial objective of written
communication, but good typography can't hurt and frequently helps, while bad typography can get in the way of communication.

    </li>
         </em></p>

        <p>
          <li>Content comes first, but a little attention to form can't hurt. Wouldn't it be a shame if your well-chosen words receive less attention than they should because your printed output is hard to read or, at best, simply lackluster? Perhaps it is a sad commentary that you need to be concerned about form as well as con- tent—but that's reality. It always has been true, but the stakes are higher these days.
          </li>
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>Details do matter, and, all else being equal, you should go for the highest quality you can get. But all else isn't always equal.
          </li>
        </p></ul>

  <div class="title redheader"><p>Text 3: Looking Good in Print, by Reid Goldsborough</p></div>
            <ul><p><em>
        <li>Don't create "whispering" headlines that fail to stand out. Headlines should be larger and bolder than the text they introduce or they'll lead to gray and boring-looking pages.

        </li>
             </em></p>

            <p>
              <li>Don't use too many typefaces. This is still one of the oldest but most common mistakes, and it can make a desktop published work look amateurish and confusing.
              </li>
            </p>

            <p>
              <li>Don't use too many text special effects. Placing text over a darkly shaded or intricately designed pattern, overusing rotated text, and including too many irregularly shaped text hlocks can make a page look frivolous and make reading difficult.
              </li>
            </p></ul>

            <div class="title redheader"><p>Text 4: Modern Trends in Typography</p></div>
                      <ul><p><em>
                  <li>In the attempt to break from tradition, hundreds of new type designs found their way to the type-founders catalogs, with some weird and im- practical results.
                  </li>
                       </em></p>

                      <p>
                        <li>A prevalent notion that sans serif is not as readable as old style is based upon its comparative newness and not upon any innate structural defect.
                        </li>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <li>The stiff and formal arrangement of type in symmetrical balance does not meet the requirements of competitive selling by visual means. Newer techniques of color and form are supplanting the formal, ordered methods of a slower-paced, more leisurely time.
                        </li>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <li>The sans serif types are admirably suited to modern ideas and methods. The wide range of weight, from light to ultra bold, with oblique variations, meets the demands of the time for printing based upon function rather than tradition.
                        </li>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <li>The most significant tendency in modern typography is a trend toward the functional employment of type, rather than its use based upon tradition.
                        </li>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <li>The trend in modern typography is definitely toward sim- plicity and legibility, employing forms that comply with the natural inclination of the human eye to seek harmony and ease.
                        </li>
                      </p></ul>

                            <li>Type defines a publication's personality. As a result, the appearance and readability can be most affected by the selection of typefaces, type styles, and type size. Although the options are forever expanding, the art of typography requires careful choices based on specific considerations. The primary goal of typography is to create a page that is consistent, harmonious, and balanced.
