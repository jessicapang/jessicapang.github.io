		<center><h6>by Melle Kromhout and Peter McMurray</h6></center>
		<h2>IDEA</h2>
		<ul>
<li>Use Tumblr as my repost medium.</li>
<li> Use writing as the primary focus for language in this project.</li>
<li>Display different writing styles through images and as they the viewer gradually scrolls down the page a relationship between the different writing styles will be established. (example:thai writing is similar to khmer writing )</li>
</ul>
