    <p>TO REQUIRE OUR STUDENTS to design and format their docu- ments using a word processor like Microsoft Word or WordPerfect is to expect them to be typesetters. If students are to meet our typo- graphical expectations, they may require a little help from us. Regard- less of the particular type of document students will produce- technical report, resume, newsletter-knowing a few basics in typogra- phy can make a substantial difference in the final product.</p>

    <p>	Think: Readability
Type defines a publication's personality. As a result, the appearance and readability can be most affected by the selection of typefaces, type styles, and type size. Although the options are forever expanding, the art of typography requires careful choices based on specific con- siderations. The primary goal of typography is to create a page that is consistent, harmonious, and balanced.

Typefaces, Styles, and Sizes
Often named after a designer, a typeface or "face" (e.g., Goudy Old Style) is an interpretation of a character set that shares a similar appearance and design. The character set includes letters, numbers, punctuation, and symbols. The best advice to offer students is to choose no more than two different typefaces, make selections based on the document's message, and use typefaces consistently. Familiar- ity with the two categories of typeface, serif and sans serif, will also assist students in setting readable body text and eye-catching head- ings. Serif type, characterized by small finishing strokes that guide the reader's eye ftom letter to letter, is best used for body text. Sans (French for "without") serif type is recommended for headings and subheadings.

<p>	Too much variety can be distracting and conflising to the reader; therefore, type style variations of a typeface should be used with care. Frequently used type styles are bold, italic, and small caps. Use these three styles primarily to emphasize and clarify text: bold for headings and subheadings; italics for names of publications and for emphasis. Small caps, besides being useful in headings, are good for abbrevia- tions (A.M., P.M.) and acronyms (NATO, RAM). Although it is an option available on most word processing and desktop publishing packages, encourage students to avoid the underline. Readers recog- nize words by their shape; underlining text will obscure it. Notice how the underline intersects descenders, or letters like g,i, y_, and p.
Type is measured in points (about 72 points equals one inch) ftom top of a typeface's ascenders (letters such as h and I) to the bottom of its descenders (letters such as p and y). Body text is usually between 10 and 14 points. Any size larger than 14 points is considered display type and is reserved for headings, subheads, or pull quotes. Encourage stu- dents to use a hierarchy of sizes, with headings larger than the other textual items in the publication.
Remember, type is measured in points; it is not larger when capital- ized. Discourage students from using ftill capitalization. Text set entirely in uppercase type is harder to read. It also takes up signifi- cantly more space than the same text set in a combination of upper and lowercase type. For maximum readability, capitalize proper nouns and first letters of headings and subheads.
