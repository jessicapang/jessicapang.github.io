    <h2>Beyond Courier: Good writing deserves Good Typography</h2>

  <p>Words on paper: that's the end result of mostpersonal computing, at least in library related fields. The author revisits a topic covered exten- sively in his earlier articles, but takes on a very different aspect this time around: typographic options for word processing. Content may be the crucial objective of writtencommunication, but good typography can't hurt and frequently helps, while bad typography can get in the way of communication. The author notessomemajoroptionsfordesktoptypogra- phy, discusses some of the issues involved in making the choices, and reviews Swfte Glyphix,a lesser-known system for generating any size typeface, as needed, while using Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. January-March 1990 brought more of the same in PC magazines; the most interesting new devel- opment for library PC users might be the intro- duction of the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III, which has been used to "typeset" this issue
of Library Hi Tech.</p>

  <p>	Writing, editing, revising: that's what most of us use a personal computer for, most of the time. That's been true ever since decent word-processing software became available—and, multimedia advocates to the contrary, it will probably be true into the indefinite future. The point of all this computerized text manipula- tion is usually to put the right set of words on paper so that someone else will read what we have to say. Not always, to be sure: other outlets for text processing include electronic mail, electronic publishing, and hypertext.Iuseelectronicmaileveryday,andtheother column I currently write is for PACS Review, an electronic journal. But I'm willing to predict that next year, at the turn of the century, and when I retire, the overwhelming majority of writing and reading (exclud- ing casual memos) will involve print on paper.
    <br>
Beginning five years ago, I devoted four Common Sense Personal Computing articles to aspects of this process: two columns on word processing itself, one on printers, and one on "desktop typesetting"—using word-processing software to produce near-typeset printed output. These topics continue to be vital, and the improvement in related technologies has been substantial; now appears to be a good time to revisit the same ground.

  <h5>CONTENT AND FORM</h5>

  <p>	Content comes first, but a little attention to form can't hurt. Wouldn't it be a shame if your well-chosen words receive less attention than they should because your printed output is hard to read or, at best, simply lackluster? Perhaps it is a sad commentary that you need to be concerned about form as well as con- tent—but that's reality. It always has been true, but the stakes are higher these days. The first rule of good form is to avoid bad form. If you're using a low-density or medium-density dot matrix printer, use a straightforward typeface—some- thing that is clear, legible, and readable at low density. I'm always put off a little when I get something done in blackletter ("Old English") on an ImageWriter, and thick, clumsily spaced versions of Times or Helvetica aren't much better. There's a reason that Courier is so widely used: it was designed by IBM to perform well under adverse conditions. Few conditions are more adverse than an old 9-pin dot-matrix printer with a worn-out ribbon; if that's what you're stuck with, don't try to be too fancy.
    <br>
  But these days you really shouldn't be stuck with that, and you should not tolerate poor attempts at imitating good typography. When you can buy a well- made Epson 24-pin dot matrix printer for $350 or less and get clear, readable type; when you can spend $150 more and get 300-dot-per-inch inkjet printing on plain paper from Hewlett-Packard; when you can get full HP LaserJet quality for less than $1,000—there's very little excuse for hard-to-read output.
  </p>

  <h5>TASTE AND APPROPRIATENESS</h5>

  <p>	When you have a decent contemporary printer (and, yes, even today's under-$200 9-pin printers will produce good output), you still need to think about how your output will look. It's easy to "try too hard"—using typefaces for dot matrix printers that really require laser quality, using screen resolution typefaces that look amateurish when printed out, and using too many different typefaces or bad combinations of typefaces.
  Just because it's so easy to go beyond Courier in 1990, don't assume that you should use three different typefaces for a one-page memo or a twelve-page article.
    <br>
  Few documents ofany length should include more than two typefamilies such as Optima, Times Roman, Zapf Calligraphic, or Stone Serif, except when additional designs are used for specific illustrative purposes. My current book includes something like thirty different type families—but only for purposes of illustration, since it's a book on desktop publishing. Except for figures, the entire book uses one type family, Zapf Calligraphic, with a total of four different type sizes. Information Standards Quarterly also uses a single type family throughout; other than boxed items, so does the LITA Newsletter. (I edit and "typeset" both of these publications.)
  Most of this article concerns some contemporary options for typography, particularly for laser printers. First, however, a few words about word-processing software.
